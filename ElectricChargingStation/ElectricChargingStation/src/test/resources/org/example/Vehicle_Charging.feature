Feature: Charging Vehicle
    As a customer,
    I want to manage the charging cycle
    so that I can charge my vehicle the way I want.

    Background:
        Given I am logged in as customer
        And a charging station with name "Stephansplatz" exists
        And a charging point with name "AC_1" exists at charging station "Stephansplatz"
        And the charging point with name "AC_1" has the status "in Betrieb frei"


    Scenario: Ladestelle wählen
        When I go to the charging station with the name "Stephansplatz"
        Then I see all the charging points
        And I select the charging point "AC_1"
        And I see the details of the charging point:
            | location                  | "Wien"          |
            | charging station          | "Stephansplatz" |
            | charging point            | "AC_1"          |
            | charging mode             | "AC"            |
            | price kWh                 | "5.83 EUR"      |
        And a button that says "Ladevorgang starten"


    Scenario: Ladevorgang starten
        Given I am in the details view of the charging point "AC_1"
        When I click on the button "Ladevorgang starten"
        Then I see a confirmation that charging can start now
        And I get a notification
        And the details view starts the timer
        And it shows the price when starting the charging
        And it shows the calculated total price
        And it shows the button "Ladevorgang beenden"

        Given I am in the details view of the charging point "AC_1"
        And I have started the charging cycle
        When I click on the button "Ladevorgang beenden"
        Then I see a confirmation that charging has stopped
        And I get a notification that the charging process has ended
